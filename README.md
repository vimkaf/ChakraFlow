# ChakraFlow
ChakraFlow is a cross-platform (Windows &amp; Linux) network control and monitoring app built with NativePHP. Inspired by the flow of chakra in Naruto, ChakraFlow helps you take control of your internet connections — deciding which apps can release their “chakra” (data) and which ones should be sealed away.
